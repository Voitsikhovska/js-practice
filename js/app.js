/* Lesson assignment:

1) Create a variable numberOfFilms and place the userâ€™s answer to the question in it:
'How many films have you seen already?'

2) Create a personalMovieDB object and place the following properties in it:
     - count - the answer to the first question is sent here
     - movies - place an empty object in this property
     - actors - also place an empty object
     - genres - place an empty array here
     - privat - place a boolean (logical) value false in this property

3) Ask the user two questions:
     - 'One of the last films you watched?'
     - 'How much would you rate it?'
The answers should be placed in separate variables
Write responses to the movies object in the format:
     movies: {
         'logan': '8.1'
     }

Check that everything works without errors in the console */
